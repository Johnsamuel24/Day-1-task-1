         Difference between HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP 2

		<ul>
<li>It was developed in the year 1997.<br><br></li>



<li>It uses text-based protocol to encode and transmit data.<br><br></li>

<li>It compresses data by itself.<br><br></li>
	
<li>The client sends a request to a server and the server sends a response back to the client.<br><br></li>

<li>It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.<br><br></li>

<li>A separate connection is established for each request and response , which can add overhead and latency.<br><br></li>
	
<li>The head of line blocking , blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.<br><br></li>
	


<li>HTTP 1.1 cannot handle buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the lack of sufficient measures.<br><br></li>

<li>HTTP 1.1 does not include any in-built features, so the performance it delivers is less efficient.<br><br></li>
<br>
</ul>

	<span class="h">HTTP 2 :-</span> 
	<br><br><br>
	<div  class="container-fluid">
	<div class="http2">
<br>
<ul>
<li>It was developed in the year 2015.<br><br></li>

<li>It uses HPACK for data compression.<br><br></li>

<li>It works on the binary protocol as a series of binary codes encode and transmit data rather than plain text.<br><br></li>

<li>A different underlying protocol called Secure Remote Protocol 2 (SRP2) establishes a secure connection between a client and a server.<br><br></li>

<li>It allows multiplexing so multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection.<br><br></li>

<li>It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages. <br><br></li>

<li>HTTP 2 includes measures to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.<br><br></li>

<li>HTTP 2 is designed to give more performance and more efficient than HTTP 1.1. <br><br></li>

<li>This is because HTTP 2 includes several features like multiplexing, binary protocol and header compression.<br><br></li>
